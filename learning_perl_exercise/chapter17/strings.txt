The first time I met Kirei, he was still a little stupid warrior. I
was summoned by him in the Dark Forest Root before the white light of
Sif the Giant Wolf. After I showed up, I saw him smiled timidly. He
was armored in the wanderer set and bearing the drake sword and
the dragon crest shield.

We can't communicate much, but I could tell he was a trainless
newbie. I intentioned to let him go through the white light first. But
he seemed not understand me and just watched me there.

Maybe he didn't know he must go throught first which indicated that
it's the first time he summoned others.

Well, if not for the sake of sun, I won't give him a hand. I wait
patiently and continually point to the white light.

Finally, he understood and walked through. Not tackled by the
mysterious power, I walked through too.

The moment the white light faded, I saw he was knocked down by Sif. He
couldn't even dodge the simplest jump attack. What a pity.
